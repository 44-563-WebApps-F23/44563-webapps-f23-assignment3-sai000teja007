    <h2>Favorite vacation spot - Los Angeles</h2>
    <p><strong>Los Angeles</strong> strikes me as being pretty unique due 
        to its amazing diversity. There is something for everyone, from the 
        Santa Monica beaches' pristine waters to Hollywood's glitzy lights. 
        I enjoy the city's thriving arts community, top-notch food options, 
        and close access to stunning natural areas like Griffith Park.<strong>Los Angeles</strong> 
        has it everything, whether you like culture, entertainment, or just lounging by the water.</p>
